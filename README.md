# Web-scraping-challenge
Project begins with initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.   1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.  2. Screenshots of your final application.  3. Submit the link to your new repository to BootCampSpot.  4. Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file  ## Hints  * Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.  * Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.  * Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
