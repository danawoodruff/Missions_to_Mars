# Web-scraping-challenge
Project begins with initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.<br>
<br>
1. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scraping code used.  <br>

## Hints  * Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.  <br>
* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. Overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.  <br>
* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.<br>
