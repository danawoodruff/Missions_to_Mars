Project begins with initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.<br>
<br>
1. The Jupyter Notebook contains the scraping code and the dictionary of information is saved as a Mongo database. <br>
2. The Jupyter Notebook is then converted to a python file for use in a Flask app.  
3. The Flask app has two routes- one for scraping new data from NASA and the other to redirect to the HTML home page code.
